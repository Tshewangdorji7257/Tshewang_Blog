# Backup and Restore on Linux Systems

Linux systems provide a range of powerful tools for backing up and restoring data, designed to be both efficient and secure. These tools help ensure that our data is not only protected from loss or corruption but also easily accessible when needed.

## Backup Tools on Ubuntu

When backing up data on an Ubuntu system, we have several options, including:

- **Rsync**
- **Deja Dup**
- **Duplicity**

### Rsync
Rsync is an open-source tool that allows for fast and secure backups, whether locally or to a remote location. One of its key advantages is that it only transfers the portions of files that have changed, making it highly efficient when dealing with large amounts of data. Rsync is particularly useful for network transfers, such as syncing files between servers or creating incremental backups over the internet.

### Duplicity
Duplicity is another powerful tool that builds on Rsync but adds encryption features to protect the backups. It allows you to encrypt your backup copies, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure even if stored on remote servers, FTP sites, or cloud services like Amazon S3. Duplicity provides an extra layer of security while maintaining Rsync's efficient data transfer capabilities.

### Deja Dup
Deja Dup offers a user-friendly graphical interface for backing up data, making it an excellent choice for those who prefer a simpler approach. Behind the scenes, it uses Rsync and supports encrypted backups, just like Duplicity. It's ideal for users who want quick, easy access to backup and restore options without needing to dive into the command line.

### Encryption and Backup Security
Ensuring the security of your backups is just as important as creating them. Encrypting your backup data helps safeguard it from unauthorized access. On Ubuntu systems, you can use additional encryption tools like GnuPG, eCryptfs, or LUKS to add another layer of protection to your backups.

## Installing Rsync on Ubuntu

To install Rsync on Ubuntu, use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install rsync -y
```

This will install the latest version of Rsync on the system.

### Backup a Local Directory Using Rsync

To backup an entire directory using Rsync, you can use the following command:

```bash
rsync -av /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```

- The `-a` (archive) option preserves file attributes, such as permissions, timestamps, etc.
- The `-v` (verbose) option provides detailed progress output.

### Backup with Compression and Incremental Backups

To customize the backup process with compression and incremental backups, use the following command:

```bash
rsync -avz --backup --backup-dir=/path/to/backup/folder /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```

- The `-z` option enables compression for faster transfers.
- The `--backup` option creates incremental backups in the specified backup directory.
- The `--delete` option removes files from the remote host that are no longer present in the source directory.

### Restoring Data from Backup Server

To restore a directory from the backup server, use:

```bash
rsync -av user@remote_host:/path/to/backup/directory /path/to/restore/directory
```

### Encrypted Rsync Transfer

To ensure the security of your rsync file transfer, you can combine Rsync with SSH for encryption:

```bash
rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```

This ensures that the data transfer occurs over an encrypted SSH connection, providing confidentiality and integrity protection for the data.

## Auto-Synchronization with Rsync

You can automate the synchronization process using cron jobs. First, create a script called `RSYNC_Backup.sh` to trigger the rsync command to sync your local directory with the remote one. This requires key-based authentication to bypass entering your password each time.

### Generating SSH Key Pair

To generate a key pair for SSH authentication, run:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
```

Follow the prompts to specify the location and optionally provide a passphrase (leave it empty for no passphrase).

### Copy Public Key to Remote Server

To copy the public key to the remote server:

```bash
ssh-copy-id user@backup_server
```

### Creating the Backup Script (`RSYNC_Backup.sh`)

Create a script to automate the rsync backup:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```

### Set Script Permissions

Make the script executable by running:

```bash
chmod +x RSYNC_Backup.sh
```

### Setting Up Cron Job

To automate the backup every hour, open the crontab and add the following line:

```bash
0 * * * * /path/to/RSYNC_Backup.sh
```

This will run the `RSYNC_Backup.sh` script at the top of every hour.

## Testing Rsync with Pwnbox

To test Rsync locally, create two directories on Pwnbox:

1. `to_backup` (for the original data)
2. `synced_backup` (where the synchronized data will be copied)

Then, use Rsync to transfer data from the `to_backup` directory to `synced_backup`.

### Automating Local Sync with Cron Job

Set up a cron job to run every minute to ensure continuous synchronization:

```bash
* * * * * rsync -av /path/to/to_backup /path/to/synced_backup
```

With this setup, you can ensure that both directories stay synchronized, even in a local environment.

By using tools like Rsync, Duplicity, and Deja Dup, along with proper security measures such as encryption and SSH, you can ensure that your data is safely backed up and easy to restore when needed.
