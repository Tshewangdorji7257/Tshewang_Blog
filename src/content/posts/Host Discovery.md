# Host Discovery with Nmap

Host discovery is a crucial first step in network penetration testing, allowing us to identify which systems are active on the target network. Nmap provides several powerful options for discovering hosts, with different methods suited for various scenarios.

## Basic Host Discovery

The most common method uses ICMP echo requests (ping) to detect active hosts:

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5
```

This command:

- Scans the entire 10.129.2.0/24 network
- Uses `-sn` to disable port scanning
- Saves results in all formats (`-oA`)
- Filters output to show only active hosts

## Practical Examples

1. **Network Range Scanning**```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet
```


2. **IP List Scanning**```bash
sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst
```


3. **Single Host Discovery**```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace
```



## Understanding Results

To verify why a host is marked as "alive," use the `--reason` option:

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --reason
```

This shows the exact reason for the host's status, such as "received arp-response" or "received icmp-response."

## Best Practices

1. **Documentation**  - Always save scan results (`-oA`)
  - Use consistent naming conventions
  - Document different tool results separately


2. **Method Selection**  - Use ARP ping for local networks
  - Use ICMP echo for cross-subnet scanning
  - Use TCP ping when ICMP is blocked
  - Use ACK scans for firewall testing


3. **Verification**  - Always verify results with multiple methods
  - Use `--packet-trace` for troubleshooting
  - Check for false negatives due to firewalls



Host discovery is the foundation of network penetration testing. Understanding these methods and their limitations helps ensure accurate network mapping and effective testing strategies.
